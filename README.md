# APP 1: React Wines
Tonight we're going to build a simple React app using around newly acquired Axios skills. For our data, we'll be using the wine api from [Arun's handy API generator](http://myapi-profstream.herokuapp.com/).

### Completion
Part 1 - 4 is required - Part 5 is bonus

### Submission
Homework is due tonight by midnight.

### Assignment
Build a Wine Management app!  Your app should have div that is a viewing window and a list of buttons.  The top button should say "view all", and when you click it all of the wines are rendered to the viewing window.  You should also have a list of buttons, one button for each wine.  Each button should say "view wine ${wine.id}".  Then when you click on that button, info about the wine fills the viewing window.


#### Note: Wine API
* Navigate to `myapi-profstream.herokuapp.com`
* Create a new instance of a wine API
* Seed the API with data
* Test out this API to see what kind of data you can get back - save the link to your API somewhere
* For tonight we're not going to worry about full CRUD functionality yet - Your app should just have views for *show all wines* and *show one wine*

#### Bonus - New Wine Form
If you finish early and want to continue practicing your React skills, try making a form and implementing the functionality to let users add new wines to the API.  We haven't taught you this yet, but we'll be covering it very soon.  Give it a stab and see if you can get it working.  Hint - it's not all that different that good old html forms!


# APP 2: Finish the Calculator

The calculator homework on Monday was tough.  Real tough.  But now we have more experience and more time, so let's revisit it and update our submissions.  For tonight, revisit the calculator and get it working.  Once you're satisfied, *update your old submission* - add a comment below the original post with how much more you've completed (out of 5), your new comfortability with the topic (out of 5).  Keep your old information in the original submission so we can see your progress!
