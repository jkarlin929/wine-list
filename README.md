# APP 1: React Wines
Tonight we're going to build a simple React app using around newly acquired Axios and Webpack skills. For our data, we'll be using the wine api from [Arun's handy API generator](http://myapi-profstream.herokuapp.com/).



### Submission
Homework is due tonight by midnight.

### Assignment
Build a Wine Management app! Your app should have div that is a viewing window and a list of buttons.  The top button should say "view all", and when you click it all of the wines are rendered to the viewing window.  You should also have a list of buttons, one button for each wine.  Each button should say "view wine ${wine.id}".  Then when you click on that button, info about the wine fills the viewing window.


#### Note: Wine API
* Navigate to `myapi-profstream.herokuapp.com`
* Create a new instance of a wine API
* Seed the API with data
* Test out this API to see what kind of data you can get back - save the link to your API somewhere
* For tonight we're not going to worry about full CRUD functionality yet - Your app should just have views for *show all wines* and *show one wine*



#### Bonus - New Wine Form
If you finish early and want to continue practicing your React skills, try making a form and implementing the functionality to let users add new wines to the API.  We haven't taught you this yet, but we'll be covering it very soon.  Give it a stab and see if you can get it working.  Hint - it's not all that different that good old html forms!

#### BIG BONUS - Webpack

If you finish the other bonus, refactor your app to be a webpacked full-stack app with a back end that handles your API calls. You might need to change where you make your API calls and the destination URL for your API call from your React app to your node server. 2 step API call??
